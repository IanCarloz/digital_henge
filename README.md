She's only tweeted twice so far, but I really adore this lil bot. She tweets the moon phases roughly around the time they change, along with equinoxes, solstices, total and annular eclipses, and zodiac signs, exclusively in emoji.A quiet, mystical thing.

I'm really looking forward to 3/20/15 when she gets to tweet an equinox *and* a solar eclipse.

Moon phases are calculated by John Conway's formula for them, rendered in js by Ben Daglish and found [here](http://www.ben-daglish.net/moon.shtml). Everything else it's just pulling from json files.
